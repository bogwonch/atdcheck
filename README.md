# Atdcheck

A little script to run text through the /After The Deadline/ grammar checker and output it in a way that Vim can understand.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install atdcheck

## Usage

Pipe in your text or pass the script a file.
Help will be written when there are more options than that.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
